*Connect 4* is a virtual remake of the original Connect Four two-player game originally launched in 1974. The game involves two players placing red or yellow pieces down 7 columns comprised of 6 slots each. With a board total of 42 slots, players need to play strategically to connect 4 pieces either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The first one to Connect 4 wins the game!

The audio integrated into game provides a realtic and dynamic sense of gameplay.
