# Bitconnect 4

![alt text](/images/bitconnect-4-README-md.png)

*Bitconnect 4* is a bitcoin-themed remake of the original Connect Four two-player game launched in 1974. The game involves two players placing yellow or red bitcoin tokens down 7 columns comprised of 6 slots each. With a board total of 42 slots, players need to play strategically to connect 4 tokens either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The first one to Connect 4 wins the game!

The audio integrated into the game provides a realistic and dynamic sense of gameplay, and the restart button is there to play as many times as you'd like. The winner gets a nice little surprise at the end!
